# Envelope Extension
This extension serves as an example showing how to get data from AP Suite, manipulate it, and show it to the user using AP Suite's extension system.
In this case, the extension performs calculations transforming the raw ion info (position, type) first into clusters of selected ions, and finally into envelopes encompassing those 
clusters and the other ions also in that region of space. The data is shown to the user with the help of the tab view template, using the ChartBuilder, text, and graphing features.
